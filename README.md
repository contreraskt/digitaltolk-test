BookingController.php Refactored Code and Thoughts.

1. Controller Class Import: Instead of importing classes individually, you can use the use statement to import the entire namespace. This can help in cleaner and more concise code.

2. Consistent Response Method: I've used the response() method consistently for returning responses.

3. Update Database Records: I've used the update method directly on the model instead of using the update method on the query builder.

4. Remove Redundant Code: I've removed unnecessary conditions and used more concise ways of achieving the same result.


BookingRepository.php Refactored Code and Thoughts.

1. Used the now() function to get the current date, which is more concise than using date('Y-m-d').
   
2. Changed the variable name from $noramlJobs to $normalJobs for consistency.

3. Extracted common validation checks into separate methods (validationErrorResponse, validateDueDateAndTime, validateCustomerOptions).
   
4. Removed duplicated error response code by using the validationErrorResponse method.
   
5. Created separate methods for setting gender and certified options to reduce redundancy (setGenderAndCertifiedOptions).
   
6. Simplified the setting of job type by using a switch statement (setJobType).
    
7. Moved the retrieval of job_for options into a separate method (getJobForOptions).

Thoughts on the previous codes:

The codes are not separated with readable methods.
The codes can be more efficient if we used Services.
The codes are quite readable.
